# MatchingGame

The premise of the game is to have a grid of 24 face down cards.

The card faces consist of pairs of matches clicking on cards will flip them over revealing the value.

If it is not a match the cards will flip back over when two are chosen.

If it's a match both cards will disappear.

The game should be different every time the game is refreshed.
